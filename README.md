# Programming Assignment 1 : Majed Salah, Sammy El-Sherif
Include a Readme.MD file in your project folder.
Describe in one or two pages the main points of your implementation, including a list of the requirements and their
current state (fully functional, working with bugs, not working/not implemented). A reviewer should start here to get a sense of your program

## PA Description
Implement a system to manage the matches and lineups for the upcoming Fifa Worldcup Qatar 2022. 
Your system will rely on a Client/Server architecture allowing admins to load the matches and players 
in the lineup for each game and record the matches’ scores. Further, there will be an application for 
the general public to query the lineups and matches’ results.
